        <h6 class="article_paragraph_header h6_next">The Basics of Search</h6>
        <p>
            The EOSC Catalogue & Marketplace is built around a robust search engine. The process begins with a straightforward basic search. Located at the top of the webpage, the basic search bar welcomes your queries. Whether you're looking for data sets, analytical tools, or research software, basic search is where it all begins. What's more, the search engine's fuzzy logic ensures that even if your query isn't precise, it can still yield relevant results.

        <h6 class="article_paragraph_header h6_next">Going Beyond the Basics</h6>
        <p>
            The basic search is a great starting point. Yet, the true strength of the EOSC Catalogue & Marketplace lies in its Advanced Search, which enhances your ability to refine your search.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the advanced search, you can filter your results based on specific criteria such as resource type, keywords, title, author, and additional search operators, including 'and' and 'or.' The subsequent operators allow you to refine your search even further by not only specifying exact phrases but also excluding specific terms. To put it simply, the advanced search enables you to find resources with much greater precision.
